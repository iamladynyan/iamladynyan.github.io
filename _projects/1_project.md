PulseMQ is an innovative project aimed at developing a fully functional MQTT 5 broker from the ground up using the C programming language. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for devices with limited resources, making it ideal for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. PulseMQ will provide a robust platform for real-time messaging and communication between devices, enabling seamless data exchange and connectivity in diverse environments.

## Key Features

- **MQTT 5 Compliance**: PulseMQ will implement all features of the MQTT 5 protocol, including enhanced error reporting, topic aliases, and user properties.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently, making it suitable for both small-scale and enterprise-level applications.
- **Customizability**: Built with extensibility in mind, allowing developers to modify and enhance the broker according to specific use cases.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for low latency and minimal resource consumption, ideal for resource-constrained devices.

## Motivation

The development of PulseMQ is driven by a passion for learning and mastering the intricacies of the MQTT 5 protocol. By building this broker from scratch, I aim to deepen my understanding of the protocol’s specifics, such as message handling, connection management, and security features. Additionally, this project serves as an enjoyable exploration of software development and protocol implementation, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical context.

## Overview of MQTT

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a popular, lightweight messaging protocol widely used in IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. It operates on a client-server model, where clients send messages to a central broker, which then distributes these messages to other subscribed clients.

## Key Characteristics of MQTT

- **Lightweight**: With a small code footprint and low network bandwidth requirements, MQTT is ideal for constrained environments, such as remote sensors and mobile applications.
- **Publish/Subscribe Model**: This decouples the message producers (publishers) from consumers (subscribers), enabling more flexible and scalable communication.
- **Quality of Service (QoS)**: MQTT offers three levels of message delivery assurance (0, 1, and 2), allowing users to choose the appropriate level based on their application’s needs.
- **Wide Usage**: Commonly used in home automation, industrial automation, and telemetry applications, MQTT has become a standard protocol for IoT solutions, supported by numerous platforms and devices.

PulseMQ will not only provide a deeper understanding of MQTT but also contribute to the growing ecosystem of tools and platforms that support IoT development.
