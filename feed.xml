Today, I’m excited to start our journey into <strong>PulseMQ</strong>, my project to build an MQTT broker from scratch. But first, let’s get familiar with MQTT itself—what it is, where it’s used, and why it’s such a popular protocol for IoT and beyond. This is the groundwork we’ll need before diving into code, configuration, and setup in future posts.</p> <h2 id="what-is-mqtt">What is MQTT?</h2> <p><strong>MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)</strong> is a lightweight messaging protocol built on a publish-subscribe model. Originally designed by IBM in the late 1990s for connecting sensors on oil pipelines, MQTT has since evolved to become one of the go-to standards for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Its simplicity, efficiency, and ability to work well on constrained devices make it ideal for environments where devices need to communicate quickly and reliably over limited network bandwidth.</p> <h2 id="where-is-mqtt-used">Where is MQTT Used?</h2> <p>MQTT has found its way into a wide range of applications, especially where low-power, low-data, and real-time communication are essential. Here are some common use cases:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Smart Home</strong>: Devices like light bulbs, thermostats, and smart speakers use MQTT to communicate seamlessly with each other and with home automation platforms.</li> <li><strong>Industrial Automation</strong>: Factories employ MQTT to allow sensors and machinery to transmit real-time data, enabling efficient monitoring and control.</li> <li><strong>Automotive</strong>: MQTT can support in-car systems and vehicle-to-vehicle communication, making it useful for smart navigation and diagnostics.</li> <li><strong>Healthcare</strong>: IoT devices in hospitals use MQTT to send data from patient monitoring devices to central databases for tracking and analysis.</li> </ul> <p>The flexibility of MQTT means it’s often applied wherever resource efficiency and reliable messaging are critical.</p> <h2 id="why-is-mqtt-useful">Why is MQTT Useful?</h2> <p>MQTT’s strength lies in its simplicity and its publish-subscribe model, which has several benefits:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Efficient Use of Resources</strong>: The protocol uses a small code footprint and low bandwidth, making it perfect for devices with limited processing power and data capabilities.</li> <li><strong>Asynchronous Communication</strong>: Unlike point-to-point communication, MQTT’s publish-subscribe model means devices don’t need to know each other directly—they simply send and receive messages through a broker, making it scalable.</li> <li><strong>Flexible Quality of Service (QoS)</strong>: MQTT offers three levels of message delivery assurance (QoS 0, QoS 1, and QoS 2), allowing applications to balance reliability and efficiency based on need.</li> </ul> <h2 id="a-glimpse-at-mqtt-standards">A Glimpse at MQTT Standards</h2> <p>MQTT has evolved to support a range of features over different standards:</p> <ul> <li><strong>MQTT 3.1 and 3.1.1</strong>: These versions introduced basic features and made MQTT an OASIS standard, bringing it to a broader audience. Most brokers support MQTT 3.1.1.</li> <li><strong>MQTT 5</strong>: Released in 2019, MQTT 5 introduced powerful features like better error reporting, session expiration, user properties, and topic aliases, offering finer control and more efficient communication.</li> </ul> <p>For <strong>PulseMQ</strong>, I’ll focus on implementing <strong>MQTT 5</strong> due to its enhanced capabilities, with the potential to add backward compatibility for MQTT 3.1.1 later on.</p> <h2 id="next-steps-setting-up-pulsemq">Next Steps: Setting up PulseMQ</h2> <p>With this overview in place, our next post will dive into setting up our repository for PulseMQ, the coding standards we’ll follow, and initial configurations. There’s a lot to come as we bring this broker to life—so stay tuned for our first lines of code!</p> <p>Thank you for joining me on this journey. Until next time… <em>Lady Nyan out!</em></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="iot"/><category term="mqtt"/><category term="pulsemq"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An introductory overview of MQTT — exploring what it is, where it's used, and why it's essential — as the groundwork for building PulseMQ]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">🐾 Hello, World 🐾</title><link href="https://iamladynyan.github.io/blog/2024/hello-world/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="🐾 Hello, World 🐾"/><published>2024-10-27T15:48:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-27T15:48:00+00:00</updated><id>https://iamladynyan.github.io/blog/2024/hello-world</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://iamladynyan.github.io/blog/2024/hello-world/"><![CDATA[<p>Greetings, dear internet travelers! Welcome to Lady Nyan’s Blog, a cozy little corner of the web where curiosity, creativity, and maybe just a bit of cat-like mischief come together. Whether you’ve wandered here by chance or by design, I’m delighted to welcome you with this classic phrase of beginnings:</p> <p><strong>Hello, World!</strong></p> <p>Just as programmers across the globe start with a simple “Hello, World!” to breathe life into their code, this first post marks the beginning of what I hope will be a delightful adventure for us all. Here, I’ll be sharing thoughts, ideas, tutorials, and explorations across a wide variety of topics—things that spark curiosity, inspire creation, and perhaps bring a smile to your face.</p> <p>So here we are, at line one of this blog’s story, in a cozy syntax that’s part code, part conversation, and all about connection. Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you’ll return as this little world grows.</p> <p>Until next time… printf(“Meow! 🐱”);</p> <p>With paws and purrs, <em>Lady Nyan 🐾</em></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A warm meow to the world—welcome to Lady Nyan's Blog!]]></summary></entry></feed>
